# 1. Assuming a circle has a radius r = 4, how would you calculate its
# perimeter? And its area?

# NB: The constant pi is implemented in the pi vector
pi

# 2. After reading the help page of the functions ?choose and ?factorial,
# try to calculate:

# - 10!
# - binomial coefficient (10 3)

# 3. Define a vector x containing the outcomes obtained for n = 6 different exams
# (feel free to choose the grades!).

# - How do you calculate the average grade?
# - The standard deviation of the grades?
# - What if we wanted to calculate the variance?

# - NB: The formula used by R to calculate the variance of a vector of n
#   elements involves dividing the sum of the squared deviations from the mean
#   by (n - 1). How would you correct the result returned by R in the
#   previous points to obtain the variance as the sum of the squared
#   deviations from the mean divided by n instead of n - 1?

# 4. Use R's help to search for which functions can be used to
# sort a numeric vector of n elements. Then, sort the
# vector x
x <- c(10, 4, 2, -3, 11, -5)
# listing the elements in descending order.
